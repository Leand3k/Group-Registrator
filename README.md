# Group Registrator

#### Description: 

This is the repository with the source code of _Group Registrator_, a simple program that takes **three inputs**:

**members**: These are the people that will be grouped.

**subjects**: These are the subject that will be related to the groups created.

**groupsGiven**: This is the number that we will determinate how many groups you will have.

# How to use it

First, clone the repository from here. It will be the same for you. Then, you will need to add paths as inputs. The first input will be the path of the _.exe_. Here, I made a shortcut of the .exe, so to use it just go to your terminal, add the path of the .exe, [If you don't know how to, here you can learn](https://www.wikihow.com/Find-a-File%27s-Path-on-Windows). And then add the others input (as paths too) that I said up there.

### Warning:

If for any reason that shortcut doesn't work, here's another way to run the program:

Go into the folder named _bin_, get into _Release_, then get into "netcoreapp3.1", and then get into "win10-x64". There you will find a .exe named "[_Registrator.exe_](https://github.com/Leand3k/Group-Registrator/blob/main/bin/Release/netcoreapp3.1/win10-x64/Registrador.exe)". Do the same steps from above(taking the path and all) and that will be good to go.
