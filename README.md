# How to use it

First, clone the repository from here. It will be the same for you. Then, you will need to add paths as inputs. The first input will be the path of the _.exe_. Here, I made a shortcut of the .exe, so to use it just go to your terminal, add the path of the .exe, [If you don't know how to, here you can learn](https://www.wikihow.com/Find-a-File%27s-Path-on-Windows). And then add the others input (as paths too) that I said up there.
